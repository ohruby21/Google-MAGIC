 <h1>Olivia's Travel Blog</h1>
<br>
<p> My name is Olivia Hruby and this is my travel blog.  I decided to create this blog because of my deep love of traveling.  In this blog I have included a couple of countries that I have already been to and things to do in that country, things to see, and of course things to eat.  I have also featured one country that I have yet to go to, but is definitely high on my list; I put some of the same features about this country as the other ones.  I'm really excited about this, and I hope you enjoy it!</p>
<h2>Here are two countries that I have already visited.</h2>
<br>
<h2> Mexico</h2>
<p>Every summer my sisters and I go to Mexico to visit family and practice my Spanish speaking skills.  I really love it there and I am glad to have been enriched in the culture.</p>
<h3> San Miguel de Allende</h3>
<h4> Things to do/see</h4>
<p> Horseback Riding- My family and I always go to the same ranch to ride horses.  It is really pretty when we ride and there is so much to see.</p>
<p> Hot Air Balloon ride- My sisters, mom and I went on an amazing hot air balloon ride!  It was a little scary, but the view was amazing and it was really cool to see the city from such a different perspective.</p>
<p> Shopping- Whether you’re in the market, or in any of the other stores, shopping is such a fun time in San Miguel.  The markets are cute and we always visit our favorite stores.</p>
<h4> Food</h4>
<p> San Augustín- This is one the best places for someone with a sweet tooth.  It is home to some of the best churros and chocolate I have ever tasted.  This is a must if you ever go to San Miguel.</p>
<h3> Saltillo</h3>
<h4> Things to do/see</h4>
<p>Los Lirios- Whenever I go to Mexico, we always visit my abuelito’s cabin in the mountains of Los Lirios.  It’s really pretty and we enjoy going on hikes as well as stopping by our favorite creek and taking pictures.</p>
<p>La Alameda- When in Mexico, I love to visit the Alameda because there is so much to do and see.  You can go for a run, a stroll in the park, visit the playground, buy ice cream or candy from one of the vendors, or just people watch.</p>
<p>Museo del Desierto- It’s an annual tradition to go to to this museum.  It never gets old.  I love all of the fossils, historical exhibits, and real live animals like turtles, prairie dogs, and even bears!</p>
<p>Museo de las Aves- I have gone to this museum twice; before and after the remodeling.  Before, I remember it being nice, but nothing extremely interesting.  After the rennovations, it is amazing!  There is so much to see and so much information.  The patio area at the end is beautiful and green.  There are even peacocks there!</p>
<h4>Food-</h4>
<p>Los Pioneros- This is one of my favorite places to eat.  I almost always get the same thing: barbacoa tacos.  Their tacos are delicious, and taste even better with a cup of freshly squeezed orange juice that they serve.</p>
<p>Las Brasas- This is another family favorite.  They have a very special plate of their unique quesadillas called “Quesadillas Brasas”.  Their lemonade is amazing, and I love to order their bistec.</p>
<br>
<h2>Argentina</h2>
<p>For my oldest sister's senior trip, my family and I took a trip to Argentina.  We visited several cities, and these are just some of my favorites.</p>
<h3>Salta</h3>
<h4> Things to do/see</h4>
<p>Horseback riding- I loved horseback riding in Salta!  My family and I stayed at a ranch that owned horses, so we rode those.  It was really pretty, the horses were friendly and well kept, and the guides were helpful were interesting to talk to.</p>
<p>Desert animals- On our way to Cafayate, a small town near Salta, I was riding in the back seat of our rental car, when my sister shouted, “Hey!  Are those llamas?!”.  We convinced my parents to pull over and we ran out of the car excitedly.  As we got closer we realized Lucia was right, the animals were indeed llamas.  We got closer and immediately started to take selfies with and feed the llamas with the corn that my parents bought for a few pesos.  The animals were friendly and definitely a memorable part of the trip.</p>
<h3>Buenos Aires</h3>
<h4> Things to do/see</h4>
<p>Bike tour- My family and I went on this incredible bike tour that highlighted so many cool things to see in Buenos Aires.  I had a great time.  They also introduced us to some of the Argentinian culture.  We were taught how to drink mate, and what some of the mannerisms were.</p>
Paseo el Rosedal- I don’t think I have ever seen so many flowers in one place.  This park was so pretty and it reminds me of bonding experiences I shared with my family through this trip.</p>
<p>La Boca- This is a neighborhood that is famous for how colorful it is.  There are so many colors on the houses that line the streets of La Boca.  It is really cool to see something that everyone knows about for the first time.</p>
<h4>Food-</h4>
<p>Volta- This is a really cool dessert place.  They sell alfajores, which are traditional desserts that Argentina is known for.  Volta also has delicious ice cream.</p>
<p>Mate- Mate is a yerba drink that you drink out of calabash board through a bombilla.  This tea is normally drunk at social gatherings.  There are many One is that when you are drinking it with a group of friends and you pass it around in a circle, if you say “thank you”, you will be skipped the next time because saying “thank you” is an indicator that you are finished.  Although I’m not a big fan, this tea is very well known and I am glad I had the opportunity to try it.</p>
<br>
<h2>This next country is one I have never been to, but I am desperate to go.</h2>
<br>
<h2>Spain</h2>
<h3>Madrid</h3>
<h4>Things to do/see</h4>
<p>Festival de Otoño a Primavera- This is a popular festival that does not only include music, but theatrical activities as well.</p>
<p>Bike Spain Tours- This is a bike tour company that can take you several places around Spain.  On the Madrid tour, you are introduced to some of the Spanish culture, history, and architecture.</p>
<p>Plaza Mayor- This is the main square in Madrid.  It was built by Juan de Herrera, who was asked by Philip III to build it.  This major tourist attraction is also home to many shops and cafes.</p>
<p>Parque de Bueno Retiro- This is one of the biggest parks in Madrid.  It is open to the public and a beautiful sight to see.</p>
<h4>Food</h4>
